/**
 * main.js — the entry point, and the whole Tauri seam.
 *
 * Everything device-specific about "how do I reach the machine and prove who I
 * am" is decided in this file and nowhere else. The device-hosted bundle infers
 * the host from location and mints a token over same-origin HTTP; a Tauri shell
 * overrides those two things and gets an identical UI. That is the "~15 lines
 * apart" promise, and it only holds because everything above this file is
 * generic — the page renders whatever catalog the hub sends, so it has no other
 * reason to care which machine it is talking to.

// the mint from a SAME-ORIGIN relative /uitoken (the protocol client's
// mintUrl() picks the relative form whenever host === location.hostname,
// which is exactly this case). Nothing about a particular device is baked in
// — a literal IP here would work on one bench and nowhere else.
//
// Except inside the Tauri shell, where the host is the operator's choice and
