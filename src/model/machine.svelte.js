/**
 * machine.svelte.js — the single reactive spine.
 *
 * Owns exactly one Valence session and projects it into Svelte 5 reactive
 * state. Every component reads from here; nothing else opens a socket, and
 * nothing anywhere fabricates a value the machine did not send.
 *
 * ── What "ground truth" means mechanically ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `samples[channelId]` is whatever arrived in that channel's last STATE push,
 * decoded by the catalog's own layout. There is no merge with local intent, no
 * optimistic pre-application, no defaulting. A control that wants to know what
 * the machine is doing reads this; a control that wants to know whether its own
 * write landed asks shadow.svelte.js. Keeping those two questions in separate
 * files is what stops the second one from quietly answering the first.
 *
 * ── Two rates that must never be conflated ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * DRAW rate — how often a widget repaints. Free (it's a couple of floats and
 * a canvas stroke), so it runs at whatever `requestAnimationFrame` gives it —
 * 60 Hz, 120 Hz, 240 Hz, whatever the display refreshes at. Nothing in the
 * render path (RailWidget.svelte, PlanStrip.svelte) may add a fixed-interval
 * timer or a self-imposed fps cap; `prefers-reduced-motion` is the one
 * sanctioned exception (PlanStrip's reduced path drops to a 1 Hz `setInterval`
 * on purpose — that is accessibility, not a performance cap).
 *
 * SUBSCRIBE rate — how often the DEVICE sends a STATE push for a channel.
 * This one is emphatically not free: ESP32 airtime, heap, WS frame count, and
 * the ValenceHubService task's own 5 ms tick budget, shared across every
 * channel ~30 of them subscribed at once. This is the rate `MAX_SUBSCRIBE_HZ`
 * and `TELEMETRY_HZ` below actually govern. A higher DRAW rate cannot make a
 * ragged SUBSCRIBE rate look better — more frames just render the same uneven
 * samples more finely (see telebuf.js's interpolation, which is where
 * smoothness is actually won). Raising subscribe rate is a mistake in the
 * OTHER direction too — see TELEMETRY_HZ below: the fastest available rate
 * (the catalog's 60 Hz ceiling) measured WORSE than a slower one, because the
 * hub can't pace it evenly.

 * Default ceiling for ordinary channels (settings, diagnostics, tuning) —

 * unmeasured-but-safe rate is fine. NOT a draw rate; see this file's header.
 * TELEMETRY_HZ below overrides this for the three roles that actually need
 * to be paced well. This is a two-tier policy (telemetry vs everything else),
 * not full per-priority stratification — nothing measured here showed
 * background/diagnostic channels need their own tier, and the override
 * mechanism (telemetryChannelIds()) generalizes to adding one if that changes.

 * Live kinematic telemetry (the rail comet: position/target/velocity) gets
 * its OWN subscribe rate instead of MAX_SUBSCRIBE_HZ — measured, not guessed,
 * against the real device with the carriage moving
 * (test/position-jitter-probe.mjs).
 *
 * The hub paces each STATE subscription on its own ValenceHubService task
 * tick (firmware: 5 ms — SPEC's pacer truncates `periodMs = 1000/rate_hz` to
 * whole ms and only checks it at tick boundaries). The closer a channel's
 * wished period sits to that 5 ms grain, the more the delivery shows
 * duplicate-timestamp/burst artifacts: measured on-device, 60 Hz (16.7 ms
 * period, the catalog's own advertised ceiling — NOT reachable at any higher
 * rate regardless of draw rate) produced duplicate-timestamped pushes on ~9%
 * of samples and a visibly heavier tail (p95/max inter-arrival,
 * implied-acceleration p95) than 25 Hz (40 ms = exactly 8 hub ticks), which
 * measured ZERO duplicates and the tightest p95/max-vs-median ratio of every
 * rate from 20-60 Hz tried under a full realistic subscription load (all
 * ~30 channels live, not isolated). An aligned 40/50 Hz sounded like it should
 * win on paper (also exact tick multiples) but measured WORSE than 25 Hz in
 * practice — the tick's fraction of the period (5ms/25ms=20% at 40Hz vs
 * 5ms/40ms=12.5% at 25Hz) tracked the real jitter better than alignment alone.
 *
 * Only the three ROLES that feed the rail's live comet/numerals get this
 * treatment; every other channel (settings, diagnostics, tuning) keeps the
 * MAX_SUBSCRIBE_HZ policy — this is not "subscribe to everything faster", it
 * is "the one signal a human's eye tracks in real time gets a SUBSCRIBE rate
 * chosen for even pacing, independent of and much lower than the DRAW rate
 * that renders it".

  // smaller than that. Over-subscribing did NOT earn a NACK — the SUBSCRIBE was

  // and every readout on every tab rendered `--`. It looked like a rendering
  // bug and was a protocol-etiquette bug. The simulator hid it by advertising
  // fewer channels.
  //
  // The cap is whatever the hub declared in WELCOME, so this adapts to any
  // machine rather than hardcoding a number. When we have to drop some, drop
  // the LEAST important: sorting by priority descending keeps safety and motion
  // and sheds background diagnostics, which is the same ordering the hub itself
  // uses when it sheds under congestion (SPEC 10.4).

/**
 * Send SUBSCRIBE in batches that fit the hub's declared per-frame wish cap.
 *
 * ── Two field bugs, and the corrected diagnosis (RFC-033) ──────────────────
 *
 * FIELD BUG #1: the real machine advertises `max_frame: 512` bytes. This
 * client wanted 21 channels in one SUBSCRIBE; the hub dropped it WHOLESALE —
 * no NACK, no grants, no STATE. The session sat happily LIVE while every
 * readout on every tab rendered `--`, which reads exactly like a rendering
 * bug and is not one.
 *
 * FIELD BUG #2 (the one that actually mattered): the byte-size math above was
 * the wrong model entirely. A conservative fixed batch of 8 was shipped as
 * the fix, tuned down from an estimate that regressed the moment the catalog
 * grew from 33 to 44 entries. Both "mixed STATE+EVENT frame" drops that were
 * blamed on class-mixing at the time were actually this: the hub was silently
 * dropping any SUBSCRIBE over its UNDECLARED wish-count cap (16, on this
 * hub), which nobody could see without binary-searching a live machine.
 *
 * THE FIX, now that the cap is advertised (WELCOME `limits` key 4,
 * `max_subscriptions_per_frame`): batch by COUNT, sized from that value
 * directly. No byte estimate, no class split — mixing STATE and EVENT wishes
 * in one frame is, and always was, legal (RFC-033's ruling). Fall back to 8
 * only when the hub is old enough not to advertise key 4 at all; a hub that
 * DOES advertise it is trusted completely, because overflow now answers
 * `SUBSCRIBE_REJECTED` (0x0204) instead of silence — see the `nack` handler
 * below, which treats that code as a loud client-bug error rather than
 * routine congestion shedding.

/**
 * Browsers throttle background tabs to roughly one timer callback per minute.
 * The hub's deadman is 600 ms. So a backgrounded tab stops PINGing, gets torn
 * down as a dead session, and — because the RECONNECT backoff timer is
 * throttled too — does not come back until the tab is focused again. To the
 * operator this reads as "alt-tabbing kills the page", which is exactly what
 * was reported.
 *
 * There is no client-side fix for the throttling itself. What we can do is
 * treat regaining visibility as an explicit signal to re-establish now rather
 * than waiting for a timer that may be minutes away.
 *
 * ...and CLOSE ON THE WAY OUT, which is the other half. Left to itself a hidden
 * tab keeps the socket open with frozen timers, so the hub sees 20 s of RX
 * silence, idle-reaps the slot, and the (throttled) backoff timer reconnects to
 * be reaped again — measured live on fw 2.1.88 as 19 sessions in 100 s. Each
 * cycle briefly overlaps two sessions' buffers because the hub defers detach to
 * its own task, and the resulting internal-heap fragmentation dropped the
 * largest free block under the page-serve floor, so the machine served 503 to
 * every new tab until the churn stopped. One backgrounded phone did that.
 *
 * A clean close hands the slot back immediately instead of costing a reap, and
 * reconnect is cheap: the catalog is etag-cached, so coming back is a warm
 * session with zero transfer frames. Releasing control while hidden is also the
 * honest posture — the hub's 600 ms deadman has already stopped motion by then.
