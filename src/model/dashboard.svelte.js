/**
 * dashboard.svelte.js — Home-Assistant-style dashboard layout: state + persistence.
 *
 * Pure layout math over caller-supplied items — {id, title, snippet}. This
 * file has never heard of a channel, a field, or a machine; it only knows
 * "some string id wants a span and a position." That is deliberate: the
 * device-knowledge checker (test/check-device-knowledge.mjs) enforces zero
 * wire vocabulary above the Valence protocol client, and a dashboard-layout engine has no
 * business needing any.
 *
 * ── STABILITY ACROSS MACHINES IS THE KEY REQUIREMENT ────────────────────────
 * The saved layout is a MAP keyed by item id — { [id]: {span, order} } — never
 * an array. That is the whole reason ids are stable strings and not indices:
 * an array position means nothing once the set of widgets changes, but a map
 * entry either matches an id or it doesn't.
 *   - An id present in storage but ABSENT from the current `items` (a
 *     different machine, a hidden feature) is simply never visited by
 *     arrange() below — it stays in storage, inert, in case that machine
 *     comes back, but it can never crash or misplace anything live.
 *   - An id present in `items` but ABSENT from storage (a new machine, a
 *     freshly added widget) gets DEFAULT_SPAN and appends after every item
 *     storage does know about, in the order `items` was handed to us.
 * Connecting to a different machine therefore never scrambles a saved layout
 * and never throws — worst case, some items you don't recognize sit unused in
 * localStorage and some items you do have land at the end with a default span.
 *
 * All localStorage access is wrapped in try/catch: private browsing, a full
 * quota, or storage disabled outright must degrade to "layout doesn't
 * persist," never to a broken page.
