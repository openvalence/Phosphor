/**
 * telebuf.js — a tiny ring-buffer interpolator for smoothing ONE live scalar.
 *
 * This is a deliberately shrunk port of the pre-refactor `core/telebuf.js`.
 * The original also did WS-frame parsing and dual-clock (device/client) sync
 * because it fed off a raw binary telemetry plane; that plane is gone. Here,
 * `machine.svelte.js` already timestamps every decoded STATE sample
 * (`machine.sampleTs[channelId]`) with `Date.now()` — the epoch-ms domain set
 * at `session.js`'s `emit('state', ..., Date.now())` — so there is nothing
 * left to synchronize — a caller just pushes {value, tsMs} pairs as they
 * arrive off `machine.samples`/`machine.sampleTs`.
 *
 * CLOCK-DOMAIN TRAP (bit us once, guard stays): `sampleAt(tMs)` must be
 * called with a timestamp in that SAME Date.now() epoch-ms domain. A
 * `requestAnimationFrame` callback's own argument is a DOMHighResTimeStamp —
 * ms since `performance.timeOrigin`, a much smaller number — and passing it
 * straight through makes `tMs` permanently "older" than every real sample in
 * the ring, so `sampleAt()` always takes the `tMs <= bufT[head]` branch and
 * returns the OLDEST entry still buffered: with the default 256-deep ring at
 * ~30 Hz that reads as the display lagging live position by ~8-9 SECONDS,
 * constantly, which is exactly the "incredibly laggy" field report this
 * comment exists to prevent a repeat of. Callers driven by rAF must convert
 * with `performance.timeOrigin + rafTimestamp` before calling `sampleAt()` —
 * see RailWidget.svelte's `draw()`.
 *
 * What is kept, because it is still true at ~20-30 Hz STATE cadence rendered
 * at 60 fps rAF: samples arrive slower than frames are drawn, so a caller
 * wanting a smooth line needs to interpolate BETWEEN real samples and briefly
 * extrapolate PAST the newest one along its last velocity rather than
 * snapping/holding — the same policy the original used for the rail's comet
 * and hero numerals. `sampleAt()` never fabricates a value out of nothing: with
 * zero samples it reports `fresh:false` and a null value, which callers must
 * treat as "withhold", not "draw at zero" (Ground Truth Doctrine).
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a Svelte store / `.svelte.js` — this is called from inside
 * a rAF loop up to 60 times a second, and routing that through reactive state
 * would fire the whole reactivity graph for no reason. Callers push the
 * handful of *derived* display numbers they actually render into `$state`.
 *
 * ── The render-delay bug (jitter regression #3) ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * The pre-refactor `core/telebuf.js` never sampled at raw "now". It sampled at
 * `nowSynced - renderDelay`, where renderDelay was an adaptively-slewed buffer
 * (20-120ms, `p95_jitter*1.5 + frame_dt`) whose whole job was to keep the
 * render instant reliably BEHIND the newest real sample, so `sampleAt()`
 * almost always finds two real bracketing samples to interpolate between.
 * That delay was dropped in the port (its header now says so explicitly) —
 * the reasoning given was "there is nothing left to synchronize" (true: the
 * old delay's OTHER job, device/client clock-offset sync, really is gone now
 * that machine.svelte.js stamps every sample in one epoch-ms domain). But the
 * delay had a second, independent job the port's reasoning missed: it was
 * also a JITTER BUFFER against irregular sample arrival, which is still very
 * much a live problem — Valence STATE pushes arrive at ~20-30 Hz with real
 * gaps (measured on-device: mean ~20-45ms, p95 45-55ms, occasional gaps past
 * 100ms). Sampling at raw "now" with no buffer means any push arriving a
 * little late leaves "now" sitting PAST the newest sample, past the
 * extrapolate window, so the display FREEZES (the `pastMs > EXTRAPOLATE_MS`
 * hold branch) until the next push arrives and it SNAPS forward to catch up —
 * a visible stutter, worse the larger the gap. `createRenderClock` below is a
 * single-clock re-derivation of the old technique: no device/client offset
 * (nothing to sync), but the same "buffer by a bit more than the typical gap
 * between samples" idea, driven by the MEASURED gap between real pushes
 * instead of a removed network-clock jitter estimate.
 *
 * ── jitter regression #4: 50/2 outrun by hub-pacing bursts ──────────────────
 *
 * EXTRAPOLATE_MS=50 / SLEW_MS_PER_FRAME=2 (the values regression #3 above
 * landed with) held for steady ~20-45ms gaps but were sized to the p95, not
 * the tail: the hub's 5ms tick pacing occasionally strings together several
 * >100ms real gaps in a row (a burst, not one straggler). A single >100ms gap
 * already outruns a 50ms extrapolate window (hold-then-snap for that frame);
 * a BURST of them also outruns delayMs's ability to slew up fast enough — at
 * 2ms/frame, closing even a 60ms shortfall takes 30 frames (~0.5s at 60fps),
 * so the display sits in hold/snap for the whole burst instead of buffering
 * through it. EXTRAPOLATE_MS=80 covers a single straggler outright;
 * SLEW_MS_PER_FRAME=4 acquires a safe delay within ~1s of a burst starting
 * instead of chasing it for the burst's whole duration. Do not lower either
 * without re-measuring the on-device gap distribution — these are sized to
 * the worst observed tail, not the mean.
 *
 * ── jitter regression #5: arrival-time stamping (TRAPS T18, measured) ─────
 *
 * The pushed `tsMs` is Date.now() AT DECODE TIME — and STATE frames arrive in
 * TCP clumps. Measured on-device during real motion (rail-probe.mjs,
 * 2026-07-28): 71 of 393 arrivals in 12s carried an IDENTICAL stamp to their
 * predecessor and p95 arrival gap was 90ms against a ~30ms true period. Under
 * arrival-time stamping the old push() dropped every duplicate outright
 * (~18% of all motion samples discarded), then interpolated across the hole:
 * 107 of 719 rendered frames were snaps and 17 were multi-frame freezes.
 * No interpolation, however smooth, can survive garbage timestamps.
 *
 * The pre-refactor rail never trusted arrival time: `railFeed` re-spaced
 * every batch by the known sample period and anchored it slightly in the
 * FUTURE of "now", so the interpolator always saw an even timeline. push()
 * now restores that mechanism: `tsMs` is treated as an arrival HINT, and the
 * STORED timestamp is reconstructed as max(arrival + LEAD, prev + period),
 * capped at arrival + MAX_LEAD — where `period` is an EMA of arrival gaps
 * (bursts average out: 0,0,90,0,0,85… means ~30). Steady state stores
 * perfectly even spans; a burst after a gap lands as N even spans that
 * exactly absorb the gap; a genuine stall (arrival far past the schedule)
 * resyncs forward through the max(). The render clock keeps measuring RAW
 * arrival gaps, so its delay stays sized to the real burstiness and the
 * sampled instant stays safely inside the reconstructed, future-extended
 * ring. Do not "simplify" this back to storing arrival time — that IS
 * regression #5.
