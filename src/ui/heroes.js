/**
 * heroes.js — the hero-widget registry.
 *
 * A "hero" is a bespoke control that renders a GROUP of fields better than the
 * generic widgets can: a rail with a draggable stroke window instead of two
 * loose min/max sliders, a generator card instead of six unrelated percentages.
 *
 * The rule that keeps this from re-privileging our UI: a hero binds to ROLES,
 * never to channel ids or field names. `window.min` + `window.max` is a
 * registry-defined concept, so the rail widget draws correctly on anyone's
 * machine that annotates those roles — and any other client library can ship
 * the identical widget by reading the identical roles. The nice controls belong
 * to the protocol, not to us.
 *
 * If a machine does not publish the roles a hero needs, claimRoles() returns
 * null, the hero silently declines, and those fields fall through to the
 * generic renderer. Nothing breaks; the page just gets plainer. That is the
 * "opportunities, not requirements" doctrine as executable code.

/**
 * Registered heroes, in render order.
 *
 * `require` roles must ALL resolve or the hero declines entirely — a rail that
 * knows its window but not its position would draw a carriage that is always
 * at zero, which is worse than no rail at all.
 *
 * `zone` decides where App.svelte puts a claimed hero:
 *   'instrument' — pinned chrome in the hero strip (never scrolls away with a
 *                  settings tab; the operator's live instrument).
 *   'card'       — an ordinary dashboard card in the Overview pane, laid out
 *                  and reordered by DashGrid like any other card.
