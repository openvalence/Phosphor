/**
 * check-device-knowledge.mjs — the mechanical test behind gold-standard claim
 * #1: "Zero device knowledge in the rendering layer."
 *
 * A claim you cannot fail is not a standard, it is a mood. So this script
 * FAILS THE BUILD if the UI layer above the Valence protocol client contains
 * knowledge that only applies to this one machine:
 *
 *   1. A channel-id literal (0x0081, 0x0105, ...). Binding to an id is the
 *      original sin — it works here and nowhere else.
 *   2. A wire field name lifted from THIS device's catalog (`window_min`,
 *      `chase_dense_ms`, ...). The list is extracted from the firmware header
 *      at check time, so it stays honest as the catalog grows: add a field to
 *      the device and this check immediately starts guarding it too.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY ALLOWED:
 *   - the protocol client — consumed from the sibling Valence repo's
 *                         clients/js/ by relative import; not under src/, so
 *                         this walk never sees it.
 *   - model/roles.js    — role strings like `window.min` are REGISTRY
 *                         vocabulary, not device facts. They mean the same
 *                         thing on every conforming hub, which is exactly why
 *                         binding to them is portable. Note they use dots,
 *                         while wire field names use underscores, so the two
 *                         are mechanically distinguishable.
 *
 * Run: node test/check-device-knowledge.mjs

 * produced a false positive on `estop_clear`, which is simultaneously a device

 * knowledge, so the check was wrong.
 *
 * That mattered more than the one case: a component author hit the false
 * positive and wrote an obscure workaround to get past it rather than
 * reporting the tool as broken. A checker that cries wolf gets routed around,
